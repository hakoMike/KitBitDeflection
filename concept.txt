Art assets:
Kit cowboy (main)
Kit cowboy (hurt)
Kit cowboy (victory)
Kit gun arm with revolver
vertical bullet icon to indicate remaining ammo
vertical bullet outline to indicate spent ammo
Bit images (1,10,50) (animated gifs available to turn into sprite sheets)
Rooster token (like a coin)
Rombie token
Grimm token
Miffy token
Crosshair for targetting
Elevator doors (to start and end the game)

Sounds:
gunshot (more than one?)
splat (hitting bits) (more than one?)
Ting! or ricochet (for tokens)
Kit reaction sounds (noooo! buh buh buh, etc) 
possible: voice clip from Rombie, Grimm and Rooster saying something like "You let me down, Kit" or "Guess my time was up"

Concept:
Kit shown on left of playfield with HUD
Bits drop from the top of the playfield at different speeds
If bits hit the bottom of playfield, they turn into money (kit bad react)
At intervals, a friend token starts to fall from the top. Shooting friend token kicks it back up (first one, then two then three in play over time)
If any friend token hits the bottom, game is over.

TBD:
level start/end?
end game conditions?
Miffy mechanic
any meta jokes we can fit in
